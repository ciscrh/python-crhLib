python library modules

They are wrtten in Python 2.7 for use on Windows PCs.

These are library modules I use when writing my scripts. I've also written Perl and PHP scripts in the past so they use the  coding style I've developed over the years rather than following the recommended Python style.

Much of the functionality is already provided within Python, but again I find it easier to use Python versions of my modules written in other scripting languages.
